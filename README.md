These insights drive strategic decision-making, optimize operations, and improve marketing strategies.  

## **Objective**  
To analyze sales performance, customer behaviors, and market trends, uncovering opportunities for growth, improved efficiency, and customer retention.  

## **Key Features**  
1. **Interactive Dashboards:**  
   - Overview: Business highlights, KPIs, and trends.  
   - Market Analysis: Regional and demographic insights.  
   - Product Performance: Sales and profitability by category.  

2. **Comprehensive Metrics:**  
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculations.  
   - Sales seasonality and trend analysis.  
   - Product and store performance evaluation.  

3. **Actionable Insights:**  
   - Key customer segments by spending, frequency, and value.

   - Patterns in sales dips and peaks for proactive planning.  

## **Key Insights**  
### **Overview Dashboard:**  
- Computers and Home Appliances consistently dominate sales and profit.  
- Store performance isnâ€™t directly linked to size; smaller stores can outperform.  
- Seasonal trends reveal December as a peak sales month, except in 2020 (February).  
- Customers aged 50+ form the largest demographic, contributing over 50% of sales.  
- Top customer: Keren Jones (CLV: $43,518).  

### **Market Dashboard:**  
- Men drive most product category sales except Music & Audio.  
- US leads customer base (5,674 customers), followed by the UK and Canada.  
- Inconsistent growth in high-value customers, with Australia hosting the most low-value customers.  

### **Product Dashboard:**  
- Adventure Works Desktop PCs remain the most profitable product line from 2017 to 2020.  
- Black and white products are consistently more profitable, except in niche categories.  
- Q2, particularly April, is the weakest sales period across all years.  

## **Recommendations**  
1. **Customer Retention:** Launch loyalty programs targeting high-value customers like Keren Jones.  
2. **Product Optimization:** Discontinue or revamp underperforming products.  
3. **Market Penetration:** Focus marketing on regions with low sales, such as Australia and Europeâ€™s weaker states.  
4. **Seasonal Campaigns:** Strengthen Q2 promotional efforts to counter seasonal dips.  
5. **Product Development:** Capitalize on trends in profitable product lines (e.g., Adventure Works PCs).  

## **Process Workflow**  
1. **Data Collection:** Extracted raw data from multiple tables (sales, customers, products, stores, exchange rates).  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled null values, and standardized formats.  
3. **Data Transformation:** Created calculated fields for metrics like CLV, average order value, and customer segmentation.  
4. **Visualization:** Built interactive Tableau dashboards for actionable insights.  
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** Delivered key findings and actionable strategies for growth.
